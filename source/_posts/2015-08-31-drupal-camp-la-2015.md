From an absolute noob perspective, I was pleasantly surprised by the support within the Drupal community.  Other than the initial local install, I have never worked with Drupal before.  

The event was held at the University of California in Irvine. Parking was conveniently located across the street from the Student Center where the event has hosted. There were 3 levels of proficiency and sessions to complement each.  I decided to stick with the beginners only sessions.  My company has decided to use Drupal for our next big project and being with the company for almost a month now, this event couldn't have had better timing.  

I stayed put in the Pacific Ballroom C where all the beginner sessions were held.  They were led by Acquia's, Mariano Crivello. He introduced himself as a self-taught Drupal beachboy since 2009. I was pleased with his level of passion for Drupal.  He stated not only did Drupal propel his career, but it also changed his entire perspective on life for the better. I couldn't help but be inspired.

He was very patient with the installation process and when we were all set, he walked us through creating our first Drupal blog. We were hosted for free on Acquia's cloud server.  Lots of coffee, restroom breaks, jokes and new working knowledge. We were taught how to install and implement new modules, customize the look of our site, limit new user access and understand how to identify quality Drupal features all without any hard-coding!      

While currently building our company's blog using Sculpin, I quickly understood how Drupal would save me so much more time. Why reinvent the wheel over and again when we can take that wheel, and throw on solid rubber to burn! (Hard-coding being the wheel and Drupal being the rubber) I'm excited about the potential! 

Mariano announced that at the end of these events, free beer and food are provided by the sponsors...I was heartbroken! I unfortunately had to leave early for a trip up to the mountains but I know the next time there's a Drupal event in town, I'm going to stay until the end! Then perhaps by that time, I can jump into the intermediate level sessions, maybe even one advanced and really start to feel like a seasoned dev!
