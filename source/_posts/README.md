<!-- Add embedded images to your blog first by saving them to the posts folder within images (folder location: dev.waybetter.com/source/images/posts) -->

<!-- Your image code should look like this:  -->

<img class="post-images" src="/images/posts/your-photo.jpg" alt="Me" style="width:128px;height:128px;"> 

<!-- Define the height and width of your image and place your code at your desired location within the blog -->
