# About Us
<div class="about">
WayBetter is pioneering a new approach to behavior change. We call it The WayBetter Way™. 
<br>
<br>
Our first product is <a href="https://www.dietbet.com/">DietBet</a>, a game that helps people lose weight by betting on themselves. It works by providing group support, microgoals, and real rewards. And while there's money on the line, DietBet isn't about betting. It’s about believing in yourself, investing in your health, and sticking to your commitments. 
<br>
<br>
It works. Since 2013 dietbetters have lost over 2 million pounds. Along the way, we’ve paid out over $8 million to winners. Dietbetting is now a movement with over 200,000 players in 70+ countries. 
<br>
<br>
Stay tuned in 2016 for new WayBetter products like CigaBet to quit smoking, FitBet to shape up, and SleepBet to get enough sleep.
