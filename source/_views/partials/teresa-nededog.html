Techie who wears lipgloss and dominates in Tekken. Teresa loves cooking, mechanical keyboards, bartending and laughing to tears. Great company will make any outing the best outing and she's kind of a pro. ;) She's really good at packing food and condiments to go and her favorite books are MacBooks! 

She knows she's been created to enjoy all of God's wonders and her only struggle has been to stay still!
